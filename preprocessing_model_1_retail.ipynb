    "## The Starspace Embedding Model\n",
    "We will use the page space/page embedding model described in https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace to generate the embeddings associated with the items. As described in the link, a user is represented by the pages he or she fans. In this example, pages map to invoices and the words in the pages are items purchased in a particular invoice. The page embedding model learns the embeddings for the page. Analogously, we will learn the embeddings for the invoice. Recall that an invoice represents a collection of items purchased together. A user is represented by the average of the invoices associated with his/her purchases.  "
